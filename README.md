### Intelligent Multi-Route Optimization System using Machine Learning

---

## 🌟 Overview

**SmartRoute-AI** is a full-stack intelligent route optimization system that not only finds multiple routes between two locations but also predicts real-world traffic conditions using Machine Learning to recommend the best route.

Unlike traditional navigation systems that rely only on distance or time, this project integrates **ML-based traffic prediction** to make smarter routing decisions.

---

## 🎯 Key Features

* 🔍 **Multi-route discovery** between source and destination
* 🧠 **Machine Learning-based traffic prediction** (Low / Medium / High)
* 🏆 **Automatic best route recommendation**
* 🗺️ **Interactive map visualization** using MapLibre GL
* 🔁 Swap start and destination instantly
* ⚡ Real-time routing using OSRM API
* 🎨 Clean and responsive UI
* 📊 Route comparison with time, distance, and traffic

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User enters **start and destination**
2. Backend fetches multiple routes using OSRM API
3. For each route, features are calculated:

   * Distance
   * Travel time
   * Average speed
   * Hour & day
   * Simulated vehicle density
4. ML model predicts traffic level
5. A scoring system ranks routes based on:

   * Travel time
   * Distance
   * Traffic severity (highest weight)
6. Best route is recommended and highlighted
